Version 0.2 - 2010-09-10:
-------------------------
 Heavily modified from version 0.1 by Suttoni (Thanks for submitting the changes):
  - Uses awk instead of shell for load average comparisons (handles floating point values).
  - Handles snmpwalk timeouts (reports them as such).
  - Uses human-readable SNMP OIDs (obtained by using snmptranslate).
